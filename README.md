# GeoDjango
 This is the Geodjango Project, in which user can add the locational information from django-admin. And Present them as a Leaflet map on a view.

 In this project I have created a Python / GeoDjango / PostGIS website with Git-based source control with the ability to:
I have Store geolocations in a PostGIS/Postgres database model and also Present them as a Leaflet map on a view. https://leafletjs.com/.
I have Retrieve the National Weather Service's current weather data (Temperature and humidity specifically) for the locations (https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) using the request library.
Problem faced while developing the project:-
I am not able to integrate data coming from weather API to show the temperature and humidity on the Leaflet map.
